/// A variant of [`Archive`](crate::Archive) that works with wrappers.
///
/// Creating a wrapper allows users to customize how fields are archived easily
/// without changing the unarchived type.
///
/// This trait allows wrapper types to transparently change the archive
/// behaviors for struct and enum fields. When a field is serialized, it may use
/// the implementations for the wrapper type and the given field instead of the
/// implementation for the type itself.
///
/// # Reason
/// We cannot write more than a single implementation of [`Archive`](crate::Archive) for
/// a given type, so ArchiveWith allows us to use the `#[with]` macro to give the developer
/// a more flexible interface for archival.
